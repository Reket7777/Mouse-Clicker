Follow these steps to run the Auto Clicker script:

---

### **1. Install Python**
- Download and install the latest version of Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
- During installation, ensure you check the option **Add Python to PATH**.

### **2. Install Required Libraries**
The script requires the `pynput` library. To install it:
1. Open your terminal (or command prompt).
2. Run the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install pynput
   ```

---

### **3. Prepare the Script**
1. Copy the script code into a text file.
2. Save the file with a `.py` extension, for example, `mouse_clicker.py`.

---

### **4. Run the Script**
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where the script is saved:
   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/script
   ```
3. Run the script:

### **5. Using the Script**
- **Start/Stop Clicking**: Press the hotkey `a` to toggle auto-clicking on or off.
- **Exit the Script**: Press the hotkey `b` to stop the script completely.

### **6. Customizing the Script**
You can modify the script to suit your needs:

1. **Change the delay between clicks**:
   - Update the `delay` variable to set the interval in seconds. Example:
     ```python
     delay = 0.5  # 0.5 seconds delay
     ```

2. **Change the hotkeys**:
   - Modify the `control_key` variable to set a custom key for toggling auto-clicking:
     ```python
     control_key = KeyCode(char='x')  # Replace 'x' with your desired key
     ```
   - Modify the `stop_key` variable to set a custom key for stopping the script:
     ```python
     stop_key = KeyCode(char='y')  # Replace 'y' with your desired key
     ```

3. **Change the mouse button**:
   - Select left or right mouse button by updating the `button` variable:
     ```python
     button = Button.left  # or Button.right
     ```

### **7. Exiting the Script**
To stop the script:
- Press the exit hotkey (`b` by default).
- Alternatively, close the terminal or command prompt.

---

### **Notes**
- Ensure the script is used ethically, such as in tasks or games where auto-clickers are permitted.
- Be cautious when modifying the script to avoid conflicts with other software or settings.
